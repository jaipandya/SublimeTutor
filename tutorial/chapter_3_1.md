Multiple cursors
===================

Sublime Text provides you a way to put your cursor in multiple text blocks at
the same time. Use `Ctrl` key with the left mouse button and click at
multiple places in the document to put your cursor at all those locations.
Now, when you type something, the text is automatically appended at the cursor
locations.

Multiple cursors - `Ctrl` key with the left mouse button

Exercise
---------

In the list given below, add an asterisk followed by space (`* `) in the 
beginning of each item. Use `Ctrl + click` method for it. Keep `Ctrl` key
pressed and click at the beginning of each list item to place your cursor
there. When it is done, type `* `

```

tab
caps lock
shift
control
command
option
space

```

Multiple selection
===================

Extending the same discussion around `multiple cursor`, you can extend this
trick to select text at multiple places. Press `Ctrl` key and then drag select
multiple blocks of text in the document. Once you are in multiple selection
mode, you can also use the usual `Shift + (up|down|left|right)` shortcuts to
select blocks of text.

Exercise
---------

In the list given below, drag select the items with `<==` marked on them.
Now delete them and replace with three tildas `~~~`

```

tab
caps lock <==
shift
control <==
command
option
space <==

```

Once you perform the exercise, the block given above should like somewhat like
this:

```

tab
~~~
shift
~~~
command
option
~~~

```

That was good. You are already on the road to becoming multiple selection
expert in Sublime Text. Press `Esc` key anytime to switch back to single
selection mode anytime.

selection techniques.
