Editing text
=============

In this module we'll learn some important quick editing actions supported by
Sublime Text. This would include indenting blocks, inserting line, deleting
words, upper case / lower case transforming, bubbling lines up and down, 
joining lines and much more. Fasten your belts, this is going to be an 
interesting module!

Let's move to the first unit.

1. Press `Ctrl + P` (`Goto Anything` command)
2. Type `c21` and press `Return`

Pro tip: `Goto Anything` does fuzzy matching with the file names when you start
typing. In the case above you could also type 21 or chap21 and the result would
be the same.
