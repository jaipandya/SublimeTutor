Selecting lines
================

Shortcut - `Ctrl + L`

If you want to select a line, use the `Ctrl + L` shortcut. Pressing it again
selects next line consecutively.

Exercise
---------

In the block given below, select the line with `<==` mark on them. Use the
shortcut you learned in this chapter to do so. Once all four lines are selected,
use `Ctrl + U` to `soft-undo` this. Then repeat the process four times.

```

1. This line shouldn't be selected
2. Please select this line <==
3. Please select this line <==
4. Please select this line <==
5. Please select this line <==
4. This line shouldn't be selected

```
