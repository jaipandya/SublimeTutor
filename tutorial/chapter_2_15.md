Transpose Letter
=================

Over here Sublime follows the default functionality of OSX to transpose letters
of a word. This is different from the way Sublime Text 2 used to deal it, where
you could transpose words as well.

Transpose - `Ctrl + T`

Exercise
---------

Given below are a few words which are spelled incorrectly, use the transpose
shortcut described above to fix the issues.

For example, in the first word `transpoes` which should actually be `transpose`
place your cursor between the letters `e` and `s` and then press `Ctrl + T`

1. transpoes
2. exercies
3. shortctu
4. edscribed
5. usblime

This gets us to the end of module 2. We learned a lot of new editing related
commands. Now, try to use them at work, while you are coding, working on your
next article or anything where an editor could be used.

Pro tip: Write these shortcuts on a paper and keep them on your work table.
They will come in handy for a ready reference. Remember, it is all about
practice. Over the time you'll develop muscle memory for all these shortcuts.
Then, you wouldn't need to think before applying a shortcut.
