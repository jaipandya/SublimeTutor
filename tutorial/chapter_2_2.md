Copy and pasting with a twist
==============================

## Copy

1. Selection

Select an area, press `Ctrl + C` to copy its contents. It is now in your clip-
board. You can use `Ctrl + V` to paste it anywhere. This is how copy and paste
works system wide. Fair enough.

2. Line

What if you don't have anything selected? Pressing `Ctrl + C` now copies the
line at which the cursor is currently positioned.

## Exercise

1. Let's put our learnings to some action. Copy first single quoted word in the
block given below, then paste on line 31. Follow this process for all other 
singly quoted words.

```
In a 'split' second, '65-million' years ago, a huge, 'plummeting' asteroid
wiped out the entire 'race' of 'dinosaurs'.

So, save your work 'often'. It could 'happen' again.
```

Paste the words here =>

2. You copied all the words pretty well. Now, from the same block above, copy the second line and paste it below.

Paste the line here => 

## Paste with a twist

What if I told you now, repeat the process you followed above and paste it
below? Well, that would be some work. But there is a way to cut down some of 
it.

Sublime sports a feature that lets you access your clipboard history and paste
stuff from there. Let's visit that corner.

Press `Ctrl + K, Ctrl + V`, sublime will show you a list of contents that
we earlier copied in the clipboard. Selecting any of them will paste it here.

Now use this shortcut to paste all the stuff one by one below:

Paste all the words here =>
